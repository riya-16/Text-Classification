First, there was reliably sourced content that was removed. The \"\"Changes in direction\"\" section was already reliably sourced as were the quotes. How that falls under original research I\\'ll never know. The show underwent some major changes and to omit that one of the main characters was killed off makes no sense whatsoever. The fact that two of the main stars, John Amos and Esther Rolle, publicly complained about the series and ultimately left because of it also doesn\\'t fall under OR. This was covered by the media as evidenced by the sources that were present. If someone had a problem with Ebony and The LA Times being reliable sources, they should have dropped a note here instead of removing a shit ton of content that someone took the time to write (not me) and another person (me) took the time to source. Original research isn\\'t including details about the work, it\\'s drawing your own conclusions based on your own research. In television show articles, we can use the work itself as a source for the actual details of the show. Once the writing start veering off into overly detailed garbage, that\\'s when the OR police can come out. Works of fiction should have some details about production, ratings, show changes, etc. If not, all we have is an article that say a show aired and some people were in it. It took me all of 20 minutes to find sources for the majority of the removed content - none of it was contentious nor was it OR which means it should not have been removed. Ironically, actual original research about the stupid opening titles was left in.  \"']\n",

Here it is:  Muslim scholars take this as proof that bahaullah was a decietful liar . If he was the messaih of Islam, he wouldn't take pictures, knowing that it is against Islam.   I didn't do this, But GOOD JOB SIR!   Check this edit out! I give my thanks to whoever did it!  The Truth About Bahaullah  He was a liar according to everybody in the world. He is promised Hell Fire in the following religions:  1. Islaam (He lied and he knew he was a liar)   2. Judaism (He preached against Yahweh)   3. Christianity (He pretended to be Jesus)   4. Hinduism (He ate meat)   5. Jainism (He killed living creatures)   6. Atheists (He was mentally retarted)  So, it is safe to say that one men who will definately'' be in Hell is Bahá'u'lláh!

            "['\"   [citation needed]   I had read somewhere that essentially many people that didn\\'t have positive interactions with their caregivers in early childhood, only negative ones (heavy beatings could be one) become sadists and/or masochists. They have no choice but to love such parent(s) (they have no other options, unless this is a commune) so they confuse hurting with helping and get effed up arousal/romance styles. Like knives/electricity/burning/hanging/mutilation/crotch attacks/feces eating/slavery/butt fucking till the anus bleeds, or, in milder cases, lower amounts of suffering. (spectrum between normal romantic/sex relationships and inability to form them) This almost makes too much sense to need citation but (typical of \"\"people sciences\"\") Googling \"\"causes of masochism\"\" shows only hypotheses and this is not one of them. However, there are citations for at least 30% of child abuse victims abusing their children and masochists outnumbering sadists. And some sadists probably want to abuse their children but don\\'t cause consenting masochists won\\'t get them in trouble. I hypothesize that the relatively small S&M; research community\\'s laissez faire-ness and inability to feel that Orwellian reversal of the injury-prevention drive of self preservation is perverse causes it to not think of this. Also the Google hits are all copied from what appears to be the DSM. Psychiatrists are often cold people who analyse humans like objects and many S&Ms; say giving pain is love (again the good is bad, bad is good Newspeak thing again) so a love-based theory is not really in their personality toolkit.  (Psychiatry is also almost the study of fucked up-ness (a guy who\\'s vertical 24/7 — thinks he\\'s a spillable glass of juice, afraid of people drinking him, lol) they must be jaded to effed up ppl..)   Anyway, the DSM hypotheses seem wishy-washy to me compared to the one I support (Freud\\'s ones usually do too, and look how those turned out). Shouldn\\'t there be a version of Occam\\'s Razor that says that the social sciences theory that seems least mushy to non-wishy washy doctorates is most likely to be correct?  If I was misinterpreted, my main point was that I don\\'t want to experience an intercourse that\\'s more pleasurable than regular intercourse. I want to retain the ability to have intercourse with different kinds of people without it being second-best, not just the kinkier than average.  Also, I\\'m aware that women have different thresholds where pain starts and anus tightnesses and it doesn\\'t hurt some. And that some female prostates are more sensitive than others. I\\'d still be concerned if she\\'s 5\\'0\"\" and being/practically demanding me to \"\"pound my ass faster!\"\". I\\'m now reminded that I generally fantasized anal sex with adult girls in 5th grade because I thought it was fairer. You know, a penis size to anus width thing. Peer girls were hotter, I imagined them with unusually loose anuses.   \"']\n",
